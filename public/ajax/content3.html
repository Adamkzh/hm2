<h2>Thin-Film Solar Panels</h2>
<p>
    Thin-film panels are attractive for customers with no space constraints and a tight budget,
    since theyâ€™re more cost-effective than silicon panels. Ground-mounted thin-film solar systems are common and often
    placed in large fields or open spaces. Thin-film panels are also a good choice if the environmental
    costs of manufacturing are a major concern. CdTe cells are the technology to watch for in the future of solar panel development.
