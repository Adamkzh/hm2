<h2>Polycrystalline Solar Panels</h2>
<p>
    Manufacturing polycrystalline cells is quite efficient, which dramatically cuts costs to make
    these much cheaper to produce than monocrystalline cells. Polycrystalline panels use melted silicon,
    which is poured and cut into perfectly square wafers. This melting process uses just about all the material,
    eliminating abundant waste during manufacturing.

    While these panels are reasonably efficient—usually falling between 13% and 16% efficiency—they
    rarely match the efficiency of monocrystalline panels,4 and they don’t perform as well in high-heat
    or in low-light conditions. Polycrystalline panels also tend to be larger, and their shimmering blue
    color can be less aesthetically pleasing than thin-film and monocrystalline panels.
