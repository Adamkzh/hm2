<h2>Monocrystalline Solar Panels</h2>
<p>
    Monocrystalline solar panels are the most efficient solar panels—they use a special manufacturing technique
    to get the most out of silicon, the parent material. In a monocrystalline panel, silicon ingots of very
    high purity are cut into thin wafers which are mounted in a grid shape.
    The panel itself appears a dark black, and each individual silicon wafer has rounded corners,
    giving these panels a unique look that is easy to distinguish.

<p>
    Because the silicon ingots used in the manufacturing of monocrystalline panels have a very high
    purity rating, they are exceptional at producing electricity, which results in the high efficiency
    ratings we mentioned earlier. The best of these
    panels carry an initial efficiency rating of 21.5%.3 They also require little space and
    perform better than other panels in low light.
</p>
<p>The biggest drawback of monocrystalline panels is their high cost; these premium panels can be
    significantly more expensive than other panel varieties, although costs can vary considerably
    across different manufacturers and panel designs. Monocrystalline solar panels also produce more
    waste when they’re manufactured due
    to the more cylindrical nature of the silicon ingots—the edges of each wafer are discarded as waste
    during the manufacturing process.</p>
