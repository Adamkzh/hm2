<p>While panel materials dictate most of a solar panel’s characteristics,
    there is still a great deal of variety from panel to panel.
    Look closely at the manufacturer’s efficiency ratings, warranties,
    and other design elements—like micro-inverters or mounting systems without
    racks—when choosing between solar panels. These design elements can make a big
    difference when it comes to matching a panel to your energy usage, your home’s roof specifications, and your budget.
    Look to your local solar installation experts to
    guide you through the process of panel selection and ensure you’ll be happy with your choice for decades after you install your system.</p>
